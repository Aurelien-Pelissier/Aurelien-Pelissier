* ðŸŽ“  Education:
  * I am doing my PhD at IBM Research Zurich in the [Computational Systems Biology team](https://www.zurich.ibm.com/compsysbio/), in a joint program with ETH Zurich.
  * I received my master degree from the [Ã‰cole Normale SupÃ©rieure (ENS) Paris-Saclay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_normale_sup%C3%A9rieure_Paris-Saclay) in fundamental physics.
  * I have practical and fundamental expertise in: 
    * Stochastic processes, Bayesian statistics, Interpretable ML, Geometric deep learning
    * Reinforcement Learning (Bandit, MCTS, Deep)
    * Time series analysis, Computer vision, NLP, Auto-encoders, Contrastive learning
    * Quantum Computing / Quantum Machine Learning
    * Blockchain / Web3 / Smart contracts

* ðŸ”­  My current research interests in Healthcare cover:
  * Drug discovery [[repo]](https://github.com/Aurelien-Pelissier/RA-drug-discovery)
  * Gene regulatory networks [[repo]](https://github.com/Aurelien-Pelissier/RA-drug-discovery)
  * Antigen-Antibody binding [[repo]](https://github.com/Aurelien-Pelissier/Ab-binding)
  * Single-cell RNA-seq analysis [[repo]](https://github.com/Aurelien-Pelissier/cdiversity)
